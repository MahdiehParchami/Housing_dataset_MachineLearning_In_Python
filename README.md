Implementing Machine Learning Models on Housing dataset In Python

I use a housing dataset and perform logistic Regression, decision tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost Machines techniques to predict housing prices.
I use benchmarking metrics to compare the results and recommend the better model to a real estate company. 

In this study, I cleaned the data and performed descriptive analysis to get a better understanding of the data, and then I examined Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost Machines techniques to predict housing prices. 
At first, I determined predictors and predicted variables, then I split the data into 20 % test and 80 % train and performed Feature Scaling to have 
a standard scale, after that, I built the machine learning models. Also, I used benchmark metrics (MSE and Speed) to compare models to suggest a 
better model for a real estate company. Even though Logistic Regression is faster, Random Forest's MSE is better than Logistic Regression, 
meaning it is more accurate at predicting house prices. Therefore, Random Forest is my recommendation.
